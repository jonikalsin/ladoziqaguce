I got lucky and found a guy who loves everything I make and will always try something new. I love nothing more than discussing what to make for dinner and seeing his eyes light up.</p><p>Seems easy to find someone like that, but for a foodie like me, it really isn't.</p><p>The identity of her boyfriend that she was hiding from the public's eye was, in fact, her long-time partner. But they broke up some time ago without citing any reasons.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The duo used to have dinners at their home together in Brooklyn, but that changed after their breakup.

She also shared some memorable moments on her Instagram profile which she&nbsp;spent together with her parents.</p><p><a href=#>Happy Valentine's Day to my parents. I'm seeing plenty of young love on my TL, but I wanted to talk about this OG love they have. Married for 46 years, and they are still in love like teenagers. One from North Carolina, one from South Carolina, but somehow they met. It's disgusting...their love... lol. But that love I watched as a kid and see now, has shown me the way. Through so many life changes, a jillion moves to cities and countries unknown...raising 2 kids and 2 dogs with the occasional tadpoles and hamsters. Supporting each other not only as parents, but as university students while they raised a young family. Not always having money, but being rich. Striking out and seeing the world together with adventurous hearts. And ask me if I ever saw them fight or disagree...nope. Just two annoying people in love lol...because of them, I know what it looks like, it's not just opened doors and foot rubs, but yes that happens...love is and should truly be unconditional. Who do you choose to ride out with, through thick and thin? Because of them I know what it looks like and feels like to have a real love and joy in your heart in general, and a real love and joy in your heart for another person. Hope you pressed play, that's their song. ?? Happy V Day Mommy & Daddy and anyone else down for that 40+ year journey</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><p>A post shared by Sunny Anderson (@sunnyanderson) on Feb 14, 2017 at 8:56am PST</p><p>As she rarely speaks about her love affairs, now&nbsp;what we can do is just wait for her next interview to find out her feelings towards marriage and who would be her perfect husband.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p>As of early 2019, Sunny Anderson's net worth is reported to be around $5 million.
