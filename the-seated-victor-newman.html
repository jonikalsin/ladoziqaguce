Is there something going on with him that he can no longer stand to do scenes…real concern for the actor and not bashing.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>They tape 6 weeks ahead …right before Christmas EB had knee replacement surgery</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Ah, that makes sense now. I did not know he has knee surgery</p><p>yes…so perhaps pre surgery he was in pain<br>and maybe since he would be out and having therapy for a while, I think they might have taped several scenes with him to be aired until he can return</p><p>Right about the surgery and this website had a piece about him overdoing his physical therapy many weeks later. And that caused an injury and a setback to healing.</p><p>Have you noticed, also, the whenever he speaks, he’s looking down. Who else thinks he’s reading his lines?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I will pay more attention to that in the future. I love the character and the actor who plays Victor Newman and will be very sad if and when the character/actor leaves the show.</p><p>Yes he had knee replacement but I’m sure he also underwent rehab along with physical therapy days after that surgery. People much older than EB, that are not in the great physical condition that EB boasts of, have had the exact surgery & are encouraged to walk as tolerated and discouraged from sitting too much.<br>At this stage he should be very capable of standing and walking with no problems.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>SoPea</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>February 9, 2023, 6:47pm <span itemprop=position>9</span></span><p>I wish good health and a speedy recovery to EB. As far as Victor, the character is not as important as he once was. Time to focus on the next generations. It’s time for Victor to back up and allow others to lead the stories.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>EB did have therapy there was something written that he overdid it so he recovery is now slower than he would like</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>gmabe38</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>February 9, 2023, 7:40pm <span itemprop=position>11</span></span><p>Typical behavior from patients (mostly men) who think they know more than the professionals.<br>I actually tried to find out if that was the case and couldn’t find anything before posting.<br>Thank you</p><p>Thank you I don’t follow actors personal lives I have a friend who does on facebook and twitter and she told me this</p><p>yes…typical mostly men years ago my husband had his leg operated on and was to stay off using it…well he had crutches I would go to work and he would GO see clients, when he could have had them come to his office in our house I go home I was so furious</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>gmabe38</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>February 9, 2023, 9:53pm <span itemprop=position>13</span></span><p>I hear you & know that kind of behavior well.<br>It’s male…EGO</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I noticed this yesterday!
