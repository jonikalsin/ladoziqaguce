If there was a mouse that big, there’s no way I wouldn’t have missed it. There is also a video recording of the recording process. We checked the whole process of making the soup, but we couldn’t find any problems.”</p><p>On Monday, magazine editor Eunice Lucero-Lee <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a series of photos</a> and videos to Instagram of what appears to be a&nbsp;<a href=#>dead black rat</a>&nbsp;floating in the beef soup she said she and her husband, Jason Lee, had delivered Saturday from Gammeeok’s Manhattan location.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>According to a lawsuit filed by the couple and obtained by The Post, the pair became “violently sick, causing them to vomit and seek medical attention.”</p><p>The suit states the two “sustained severe, serious and permanent personal injuries.”</p><p>The Post contacted Lucero-Lee for comment Friday.</p><p>Prior to Gammeeok’s closure Wednesday, the health department gave the Manhattan location a “C” rating.</p><p>A Jan. 18 inspection revealed several alleged sanitary violations, including a food contact surface not properly washed, rinsed and sanitized after each use; and food, supplies and equipment not protected from a potential source of contamination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmam9fp661edKorKllo53Ctb%2BMnaawpl2jxqS%2FjKmmqa2clr9us8CmpJ6dn6B6s7HSrZiuqpGjwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
