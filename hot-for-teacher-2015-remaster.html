The song starts with the singer and his friend speculating on how the teacher will look this year, with the singer declaring that he's "hot for teacher." The first verse then depicts the singer's frustration with his uptight teacher, who can't handle his screaming and needs to see him after school. The chorus is a catchy repetition of how much the singer is "hot for teacher."</p><br><p>The second verse switches the perspective to the female student, asking her how she knows the golden rule and calling her bold. The chorus is repeated again, with the addition of some playful scatting before the song ends with the singer's exclamation that he's "hot for teacher."</p><br><p>While the song's lyrics are undeniably humorous, they also touch on some common teenage experiences of wanting what they can't have and finding themselves unexpectedly attracted to people in positions of power. In the end, it's a fun, lighthearted take on a universal adolescent experience.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Ah, wow, man, that's it</u><br>Expressing excitement about something.</p><br><p><u>Wait a second, man</u><br>Asking the person to be patient for a moment.</p><br><p><u>What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?</u><br>Wondering how the teacher will look like.</p><br><p><u>My butt, man</u><br>Not taking the question seriously and responding sarcastically.</p><br><p><u>Oh-oh (ooh)</u><br>Expressing enthusiasm and excitement.</p><br><p><u>T-t-teacher stop that screaming, teacher don't you see?</u><br>Asking the teacher to stop screaming and paying attention.</p><br><p><u>Don't want to be no uptown fool</u><br>Not wanting to act or appear foolish.</p><br><p><u>Maybe I should go to hell, but I'm doin' well</u><br>Thinking about doing something bad, but realizing that the current situation is good.</p><br><p><u>Teacher needs to see me after school</u><br>Knowing that the teacher wants to see you after class.</p><br><p><u>I think of all the education that I missed</u><br>Reflecting on the education that was missed.</p><br><p><u>But then my homework was never quite like this</u><br>Realizing that the teacher is more exciting than the homework.</p><br><p><u>Ow, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad</u><br>Expressing strong feelings of attraction towards the teacher.</p><br><p><u>I'm hot for teacher</u><br>Being attracted to the teacher.</p><br><p><u>Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back</u><br>Telling the audience that the band is back.</p><br><p><u>I brought my pencil</u><br>Bringing a pencil to take notes.</p><br><p><u>Gimme something to write on, man</u><br>Asking for something to write on.</p><br><p><u>I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold</u><br>Knowing about the lessons, but finding them uninteresting.</p><br><p><u>I know about this school</u><br>Being familiar with the school.</p><br><p><u>Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how can you be so bold?</u><br>Being impressed by a bold student.</p><br><p><u>How did you know the golden rule?</u><br>Asking how a student knows something.</p><br><p><u>Ah, man, I think the clock is slow, man</u><br>Noticing the clock seems to be slow.</p><br><p><u>(What are you doing this weekend?)</u><br>Asking what someone is doing during the weekend.</p><br><p><u>I don't feel tardy</u><br>Not feeling late for class.</p><br><p><u>Class dismissed</u><br>Announcing the end of the class.</p><br><p><u>I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad</u><br>Feeling strongly about something.</p><br><p><u>I'm hot for teacher</u><br>Being attracted to the teacher.</p><br><p><u>Oh, see yes, I'm hot</u><br>Confirming that they are attracted.</p><br><p><u>Wow</u><br>Expressing surprise or amazement.</p><br><p><u>Oh my God</u><br>Expressing excitement, shock or disbelief.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Alex Van Halen, Edward Van Halen, David Roth</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maI6Ro6yJrcuepZhlj4m8sbXCaH%2BorI%2BbvLOrs56YnKCVp6xpfo9qbJiKlaKutMDEq2A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
