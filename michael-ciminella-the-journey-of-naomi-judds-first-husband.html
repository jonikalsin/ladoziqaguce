As a Freelance Remote Sports Production professional, he lent his expertise to several networks, including NBC Sports, CBS, ABC, and ESPN.&nbsp;</p><p>After thriving in sports production, Ciminella followed in his father’s footsteps by exploring the business world.

The now-divorced couple embarked on their journey of love and commitment when Judd was just a few days shy of her 18th birthday in 1964. At the time, Judd was already pregnant with her first daughter, Wynonna, whom she had with her high school sweetheart and football player, Charles Jordan.</p><p>However, it didn’t faze Ciminella.

On April 19, 1968, Michael Ciminella and his ex-wife welcomed their daughter, Ashley, adding to the joy of their young family.</p><p>Despite the initial happiness, their marriage faced challenges, and they decided to part ways in 1972. Naomi Judd’s career in the entertainment industry flourished after the divorce, and she became a notable figure. While Michael Ciminella didn’t follow in his ex-wife’s footsteps as a singer, their daughter Ashley pursued a career in the entertainment industry as an actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Naomi_Judds_First_Husband_Share_a_Close_Bond_With_His_Daughter></span>Does Naomi Judd’s First Husband Share a Close Bond With His Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he does. After his divorce from Judd, Michael Ciminella remained a devoted father to Ashley and maintained a close bond with her. He has consistently supported Ashley throughout her life, being by her side during challenging times.</p><p>One such time was when Ashley required surgery after an accident in South Africa. Upon hearing the news, Ciminella flew to be with his daughter and offered his love and support during her hospitalization.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-08_01-28-53-fotor-202308081358.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_Naomi_Judds_First_Husband_Remarried></span>Has Naomi Judd’s First Husband Remarried?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he has. Following the end of his first marriage, Michael Ciminella took time to reevaluate his views on love and marriage. Eventually, he found love again with Mollie Whitelaw, a Louisville, Kentucky native. The couple tied the knot on November 8, 2010. After their wedding, Whitelaw pursued her education at Converse University.</p><p>She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Arts History, Fine and Studio Arts, Secondary Education, and Teaching from the University of Louisville. However, she now works as a Management Professional at an independent non-profit organization in Kentucky.</p><p>Similarly, Judd found love again after her divorce from Michael Ciminella. She met <a href=#>Larry Strickland</a> in 1979 and married him ten years later in 1989.
