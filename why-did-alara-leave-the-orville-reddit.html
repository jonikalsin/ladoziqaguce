However, that power was not infinite and depended on her adapted environment.</p><p>Alara spent too much time on the earth, and her body started adopting our planet’s low gravity and surroundings, weakening her power. So, she returned home to reenergize and chose to remain there.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Screen Rant</a>&nbsp;reports that the medical officer Dr. Claire Finn had developed a treatment to help Alara regain power while remaining on the ship.

Since that screen time, the actress has appeared a few times on guest appearances, but her return as a central character doesn’t seem likely. And the main reason behind such is the writing of the show.</p><p>Halston herself didn’t know why her role was written off.
