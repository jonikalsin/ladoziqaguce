Lauren surprised me this morning when she came home from the hospital with her.’</p><p>Lauren further opened up about how she’d been feeling while her offspring was still in the hospital.</p><p>‘I just felt like I needed to pull back a little bit and have some privacy. I was going through something that was pretty vulnerable, having our daughter in the NICU and also going through the postpartum period. I took some time for myself but she is officially not in the hospital anymore. I’ve got both my babies home now and it was the best day ever…It’s a really, really happy day,’ she said in a clip posted on IG Stories.</p><p>While the couple shared the name of their new son, Lux, earlier this week, they are yet to tell the world their daughter’s moniker!</p><p>On June 16, Arie updated fans on the baby girl’s health, saying that she had to remain in the hospital for a few more days because of some breathing problems.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It was nothing too serious, thankfully, and now that she’s home with her family, Arie and Lauren could not be any happier!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRp7amecuusJ6mlK64brbRZpinnF2hrra%2BxKdkm62io7WiuYyhmKmoqWLBsHnHmq2eZZKkwal507Cgp6tdlsFutM6mnGamn6x6orLTnqlmrJiaeqOtwbJkoKGioXqmxM%2BeqaKdnpiypXnHnpilrJhivbO7waWcpqtdaYZ1f5BsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
