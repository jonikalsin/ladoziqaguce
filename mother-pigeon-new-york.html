If the person likes rats, they look at rats. If they like birds, they look at the birds. After I made them, I really didn’t care. I fell in love with them even more.”</p><h2><strong>“I know people think I’m totally insane.”</strong></h2><p>While Trachtenberg’s knitted pests and street performance tips do make her money, that’s not really what keeps her going. “You just have these animals that are reduced to living in gutters, or street corners with no water or food, and it’s unacceptable,” she said.</p><p>“People tell me ‘Oh no, that can’t be, they have plenty of food.’ The reality is that no, they don’t, they live for a year or so and then starve. That’s not OK to me.”</p><p>And so, Mother Pigeon has chosen to spend her time and energy in the city using little more than fabric, wire and concrete to speak on behalf of some of the world’s most reviled creatures.</p><p>“I just think to myself how funny it is that I live in a city with all this stuff, and I’m only looking up at buildings for pigeons,” Trachtenberg said. “I like humans too, I feel their suffering, but for me it’s animals that have to struggle in this world. That’s all I think about.”</p><p>For last week’s incredible <a href=#>“What Happened When”</a> tale, read the harrowing, bizarre tale of an Army medic who was <a href=#>ambushed by the Taliban</a> — and could only escape by some very unorthodox means.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuu9OhnKtloJ60prvNZqWer12uvLO3jmw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
