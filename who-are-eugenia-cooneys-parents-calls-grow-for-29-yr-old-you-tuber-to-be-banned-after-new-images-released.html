People who have anorexia nervosa become fixated on their weight and appearance.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>, many of Cooney's 682K fans are now urging people to report her content in an effort to get it taken down from the website "for the sake of young women and men."</p><p>Cooney&nbsp;can be seen sporting an outfit that includes a long-sleeved sweater, studded shorts, thigh-high stockings, and decorated boots in her most recent social media video.</p><p>The social media star walked toward the camera while carrying a pink bag with a metallic sheen before pausing sometimes to appear to grasp for the railing.</p><p>She again wore all-black clothing in a subsequent post, which contained just one photograph, and posed with her hand on her hip while taking a side profile shot.</p><p>However, other social media users didn't comment on the trip, instead, they talked about Cooney's tiny body and its potential effect on other young viewers.</p><h2 class=split>Fans outraged after Eugenia Cooney's 'very, very disturbing' social media posts</h2><p>After posting the most recent Instagram posts, Eugenia Cooney revived the debate over her tiny frame, prompting viewers to demand that the social media sensation should be banned from posting content that "impact our children".</p><p>One social media user wrote, "Smh not cute eating disorder should not be monetized !!!"</p><p>Another Instagram user exclaimed, "Once again Instagram lets posts like these impact our children... very very disturbing."</p><p>Another commented, "At this point there’s no helping this girl. Report these posts for the sake of young women (and men) on this app that this creates an unsafe place for."</p><p>Another one seethed, "What I don't understand is why they don't ban her."</p><p>One user wrote, "How has she not outgrown this cringe content? While her mom films her awkwardly walking around acting like Bella from twilight in her near thirties while bystanders out in public have to move around her and her filming mom..."</p><p>"Don’t comment just report under self injury," another social media star said.</p><h2 class=split>Was Eugenia Cooney previously banned from YouTube?</h2><p>In 2016, Eugenia Cooney's supporters pleaded with her to get help and even started a petition to remove her from YouTube, alleging that she was endorsing anorexia.</p><p>A petition on Change.org with more than 18,000 signatures demanded that she be temporarily suspended from YouTube and receive medical attention.</p><p>The petition read: "Eugenia Cooney has a serious medical condition and needs to seek help. She has been influencing her viewers by her serious underweight condition."</p><p>Moderator Lynn Cloud noted at the time, "She may not be intentionally influencing her viewers but showing 50 per cent of her body in videos and pictures are not helping girls with anorexia or any eating disorder."</p><p>One of the people who signed the petition said that their cousin starved herself to look more like the vlogger.</p><p>Meanwhile, the petition now appears to have been taken down from Change.org in the meanwhile.</p><p>When Eugenia Cooney took a hiatus from social media in 2019 to seek treatment, people noted that she still looked unwell after she returned.</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
