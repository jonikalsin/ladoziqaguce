The brick arch walkway leading up to Michael’s prison cell is underneath St George’s Hall in Liverpool.</p><h2><strong>Gina and Michael’s Boston Apartment – The Ashton Memorial, Lanc</strong>s.</h2><p>Production designer Nicole Northridge was fixed on the idea of finding a circular location to stand in for Gina’s lavish Boston art deco apartment but was frustrated until the show’s locations manager Jessica Dove stumbled upon Lancashire’s Ashton Memorial while walking her dog.

Due to the need for social distancing during Coronavirus, the crowd is made up of some supporting actors plus a number of umbrellas on sticks. The hall also provided the interior locations, and was where Grace’s death scene was shot in season three, during the Shelby Foundation gala.</p><h2><strong>Westminster Abbey – Liverpool Cathedral</strong></h2><p>When Tommy and Jack Nelson meet in London at the end of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode two</a>, they’re actually in Liverpool Cathedral, which was deliberately undressed. “We just wanted it as bare and simple as we possibly could,” says designer Nicole Northridge. Watch the relative heights in the scene, says Northridge, “Whenever one of them had the upper hand, they appear taller on screen, and then it switches.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOqZyao6lir621zZ2cq6tdqLKiv86nZG9llp65rrXNoGSlp5OWwaq7zaxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
