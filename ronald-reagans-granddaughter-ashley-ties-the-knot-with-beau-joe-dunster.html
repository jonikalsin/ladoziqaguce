In a stunning ceremony in Santa Barbara, California, on May 5, the beauty, 41, and Joe Dunster,&nbsp;a police officer, exchanged vows. She is a Catholic school principal. Ashley, the daughter of former President Reagan's eldest son, Michael, chose to honor her late grandfather by having a ceremony at the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, which was followed by a reception at the Ronald Reagan Ranch Centre.</p><p>Ashley explained her choice of site saying, "We looked at a tonne of beautiful venues, but we wanted a personal connection," as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">People</a>. The Young America Foundation now owns it, and it is filled with amazing artifacts and displays that reflect President Reagan's time serving as the country's leader. From 1981 through 1989, Ronald held the White House.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=#>Is Ronald Reagan's shooter freed?

She stated, "I was drawn to it because all of their dresses are made of handmade lace, and they are just stunning. They are classic, understated, and basic. I was looking for something with a classic, beautiful feel."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2a80d224-bc8b-4464-8a84-e4729c5d2443.png><h2 class=split>Inside Ashley and Joe's wedding ceremony&nbsp;</h2><p>The romantic wedding had a black, white, and burgundy color scheme and featured a few people who were very important to the bride and groom. While Ashley had two bridesmaids, Joe's 7-year-old son, Colt, served as his best man, and Cameron Reagan, Ashley's older brother, served as a groomsman. Dunster also has twins aged five, Duke and Walker. Ashley described Colt's behavior as "very sweet." She said, "He performed outstandingly while standing there."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6e80bf7d-34c3-4380-bb1b-737808e5bab3.png><h2 class=split>&nbsp;</h2><p>The cuisine itself was exceptional it seems. The menu included chicken, fish, and barbeque made using chicken and chili from Chasen's in West Hollywood, a favorite of Nancy Reagan, Ashley's late grandmother. Ashley began by saying, "It's actually where my grandma and grandpa met," before mentioning that the eatery serves "world-famous chili." Also included in the welcome bags for the guests were Jelly Belly jelly beans, a McConnell's ice cream bar, and red velvet cake, which were Reagan's favorites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/5f9b75f7-2e1c-423f-b0d5-a5c3e7840b9b.png><h2 class=split>How did Ashley and Joe meet?</h2><p>Ashley and Joe first met when they were young and reportedly lost touch later on. But when Joe reached out in 2021, Ashley and he reconnected. Ashley explained, "He just randomly reached out to me." 'Do you want to go get a cup of coffee, meet, and catch up?' he asked." She continued, â€œWe connected when we first met, and the rest is history."</p><p>Talking about her wedding, Ashley said that their "beautiful" day was perfect. "It was everything I dreamed of." She added, "It means a lot because he has three little boys. It feels really special to make a promise to Joe, but I'm also making a promise to the boys to be a part of their lives, to love them as if they're my own, and take care of them as if they're my own. It was the most special."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqp%2Bjrq2wjKucmp%2BRo8Bus9GapZ2ckaq0qcDEq2Saq5ihsrp506KcrGWknbJut82oq2avmam1bq7Emqxmop%2BaeqXBzayrnqo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
