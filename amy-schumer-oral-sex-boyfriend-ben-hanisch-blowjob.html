The comedienne is not a fan of oral sex, and dished all about how she was able to get out of giving her man,&nbsp;<strong>Ben Hanisch</strong>, a blowjob one time to&nbsp;Britain’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour</a> magazine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform Bc6EsWmi]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I went down on Ben this morning and he yawned,” she admitted. “It was an accident, but we were both just dying laughing. I’m happy, but obviously I was like, ‘F*** you.’ When I’m down there, if it’s more than a minute, it’s his birthday or something. But this morning it just happened — and then he yawned and it was a great excuse to stop.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Bedroom behavior aside, the 35-year-old’s relationship with her boyfriend of over a year is definitely going well. “He’s very protective of me,” she gushed. “Like , not overprotective, but if someone’s taking pictures of me or filming in a restaurant, he’ll start taking pictures of them. He’s really cool; it’s not a problem to be around any of the sorts of people who are at these events. He takes it all in his stride. But when I say, ‘Shall we get out of here?’ he’s like, ‘YES!’ I’m so lucky that I met him. And he hadn’t seen any of my work before we met.”</p><h3><a href=#>Amy Schumer — PICS</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Amy and Ben revealed they were dating at the beginning of 2016, and have been going strong ever since. They recently proclaimed their love for one another with sweet social media posts on Valentine’s Day, and we definitely wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a proposal some time in the near future!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Amy shared too much info in this interview?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH10e5FtZpqlqWLApLTUppyrZZ%2Bnrq150p6vZpqfrrOztcSnm2aalaN6qa3NoqqcoF2XubDDyaiZaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
