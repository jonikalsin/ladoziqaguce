Today, it remains the second most-successful movie musical of all time, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Box Office Mojo</a>, having only recently been ousted from the top spot by Disney’s Beauty and the Beast live-action reboot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From Olivia Newton John’s good girl Sandy to John Travolta’s greaser Danny, let’s take a look at what the cast of the beloved ’50s nostalgia flick is up to today.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">John Travolta</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/john-travolta-then-now-grease.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fresh off his breakout turn in 1977’s disco drama Saturday Night Fever, John Travolta cemented his place in musical movie history as Rydell High’s resident bad boy Danny Zuko. He went on to earn a number of Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA and SAG nominations over the years for his roles in instant classics like Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty and Hairspray.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For his most recent project, the now 64-year-old Travolta stars as legendary Gambino crime family boss John Gotti in the mobster biopic Gotti—in theaters June 15.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Olivia Newton-John</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/olivia-newton-john-then-now-grease-copy.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At 29, Olivia Newton-John wasn’t sure if she could pass as the high school-aged Sandy Olsson. But it was clear to John Travolta that she was the one that he wanted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She had a brilliant voice, and I didn’t think there could be any more correct person for Sandy in the universe,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> in 2016. Travolta was determined to get her the part. “I insisted that she be met and that we cast her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Primarily a singer, Newton-John has since described Grease as a <a href=# rel=noopener>“turning point”</a> for her musical career, allowing her to transition from exclusively country songs to pop hits like “Physical.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Newton-John has won several American Music Awards and four Grammys and is considered one of the world’s best-selling artists of all time. Unfortunately, she is currently on a touring hiatus due to a <a href=# rel=noopener>recurrence of the breast cancer</a> she was first diagnosed with in 1992.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Stockard Channing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/stockard-channing-then-now-grease-copy.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After winning fans’ hearts as Betty Rizzo, queen of the Pink Ladies, Stockard Channing went on to thrive both on stage and the small screen.
