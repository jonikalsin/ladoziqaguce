Considering his age, he must have graduated from both the high school and the university. Unless he is a dropout or has quit his further studies.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Trevino_8211_Professional_Life>Michael Trevino – Professional Life</span></h2><p>Michael Trevino started developing an interest in acting during his late teenage years when he started participating in high school theatre productions. Likewise, once he graduated high school, he wanted to learn professional acting. So, he went to ‘Playhouse West’ where he began sharpening his acting skills. Eventually, he started auditioning and got a few commercials, but did not get any film and TV roles. Fortunately, after some time, he got the role of Tim Browser in “Summerland” in the year 2005. This was a head-start in his career.</p><p>The year 2005 was a breakthrough year for his career as he appeared in three TV series back-to-back. His first appearance was in one episode of “Summerland” and it was followed by two small roles in series like “Charmed” and “Commander in Chief”. Likewise, in the year 2006, he was also selected to play the lead role in Disney’s straight-to-television film “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cow Belles</a>“. His portrayal of ‘Jackson Meade’ was well-received by the audience and the critics.</p><p>After that, he had some guest appearances in “Cold Case”, “Without a Trace”, “Commander in Chief”, and “Bones”. Unfortunately, his roles were mostly one-episode-long and he was finding it very hard to get the roles that would do justice to his acting talent. Likewise, he further extended his career with a small role in “Charmed” and a slightly better recurring role in “The Riches”. And, as time passed, he appeared in bigger and better roles, and his performances in “Cane” and “90210” were well received.</p><h4><span>More About Career…</span></h4><p>His career took a turn for good as he got one of the leading roles in the CW series “The Vampire Diaries”, based on the book series of the same name in the year 2009. He got the role of “Tyler Lockwood”, a hybrid between a vampire and a werewolf. As the series got renewed for further seasons, he was able to receive a lot of applause for his performance. Furthermore, over time, the series became one of the most successful and famous American television programs. This certainly helped him bag a few good offers.</p><p>Likewise, in the year 2012 film “The Factory”, he appeared in the leading role of Tad. And, his performance was praised by critics as well as the audience. Moreover, he also relived his role as Tyler in the spin-off series “The Originals”. Although his appearance was short in this series, he managed to receive further praise for his performance. Also, he was the first major character to transition from one show to another.</p><p>In the year 2015, his die-hard fans were shocked to know that he would be leaving “The Vampire Diaries”, just like the female lead Nina Dobrev. These rumors were later proved wrong when he appeared in the show. Further, in the year 2016, he made a small appearance in the series “Sunset Park”. Also, he played a major role in the Chinese film “Out of Control” which was released in 2018.</p><p>Moreover, he currently stars in the CW’s “Roswell, New Mexico”.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50329 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Michael-Trevino-Vampire-Diaries.jpg alt="Michael Trevino " width=650 height=512 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-50329 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Michael Trevino celebrating “The Vampire Diaries” 100th episode along with his co-actors (Source: Google)</p><h2><span id=Michael_Trevino_8211_Awards_and_Nominations>Michael Trevino – Awards and Nominations</span></h2><p>Michael Trevino is one of the most popular actors in America at the moment.
