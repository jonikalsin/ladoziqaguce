Just seems strange.</p><p>Leslie, Laura’s mom, Spencer’s great-grandmother - Wouldn’t she have come back for his memorial service?</p><p>Brick, Sonny’s sometimes right-hand man - After pointing to Dex as the mole, he disappeared. You would think with the return of Jason and the accusations of him being the shooter, Brick would touch base with Sonny.</p><p>Monica - I get that Leslie has health issues, but could we get a temporary recast? Jason was her golden child, and not a peep from her about his reincarnation??</p><p>Ned - We’ve covered this MIA guy plenty lately. I just don’t get why nothing in the show is addressing it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>14 Likes</span></p><p>That’s true. We need recasts for Jackie Templeton and Monica even if it’s temporary. All those people should be portrayed as going to the wedding.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>If there is a wedding … duh duh duhnnnnn….</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t know. Fans complain about a bloated cast but want recasts for every character for just a couple of episodes. It just bogs the storylines down Jackie was a very minor character. Mention her excuse and keep the story going forward</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Taggart.</p><p>He was last seen in early July 2023 pouring booze into his tea at Kelly’s.</p><p>So much for Trina telling him that he will always be her dad. She doesn’t even mention him. It’s all about Curtis now.</p><p><span class=post-likes>10 Likes</span></p><p>Monica doesn’t know Jason’s alive, I don’t think. (Haven’t seen Friday’s episode yet)</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Let’s just forget that Jackie is Chase’s mother. That whole story bombed.</p><p>Even a brief appearance or voice over from LC (Monica) would be nice. I miss her, but JE (Tracy Q) is a fantastic matriarch for the Q’s. Love her and the character! She can do so much, and is on Board of Managers for GH.</p><p><span class=post-likes>12 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>MrAxe</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>March 23, 2024, 9:58am <span itemprop=position>8</span></span><p>One of the questions I’d like to ask tptb is <strong>why can’t current characters occasionally mention conversations they’re having (by phone etc) with relatives/friends out of town</strong> … on a bi-yearly basis at least? Would it ruin future concepts? I’m thinking not (if they’re clever). How can it hurt things if:</p><p>Molly talked to her dad Ric on occasion?<br>Joss talked to her dad Jax?<br>Aidan should have a connection to yet another dad Lucky? Laura & her son Lucky?<br>Trina should reach out to her <strong>dad</strong> Taggert?<br>Tracy & Brooke with Dillan?<br>Somebody call Leisl?<br>Felix?<br>Brad?<br>Steven Lars Webber?</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>KAC</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>March 23, 2024, 11:03am <span itemprop=position>9</span></span><p>Who is aiden’s daddy?

Where is Taggart?? And wasn’t he offered the Police Commissioner job after the finding out Trina was not his daughter?</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Yeah, Wally Kurth (Ned) being missing has really bothered me because he should be comforting Olivia with Dante being in a coma. Justin Kiriakis (Wally too) also has been MIA on Days; they replaced him as Tate’s lawyer. Usually, Wally will be missing on GH if he’s busy on Days & vice versa. I hope that everything is okay with him.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Also, I miss Martin Grey. I would much rather see him than Lucy any day of the week.</p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>I miss him too. Who’s Kitty is that? Is that your real kitty? What a beauty!</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Thank you. That was Chandler, who is named after Adam Chandler from All My Children. He was the last of the 3 C’s (Chloe, Caleb, his siblings). I decided to honor him. He died November 8th at 17 years old. He will probably be my last cat because I’m 70 now. It wouldn’t be fair to get another kitten. My home is so quiet without him.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pensive.png title=:pensive: alt=:pensive: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>What a sweetie he was. My cat Serena, 17 years old, passed October 22nd 2022, I had to have her put to sleep and send her to Heaven because of her diabetes. I cried for 3 weeks and a friend of mine I owe her so much because she listened to me crying on the phone practically every day. I do have another cat though she’s 5 years old but I think she will be my last Kitty as well because I’m 71. Even though my daughter said if anything happens to me she would take care of Luna, that’s her name, I still have decided it will be my last kitty. The only thing I might do, maybe you might consider this too, is adopting a senior cat about 13 or 14 years old and making its last year’s happy, I was just reading about it, that idea appeals to me. I have my five year old Luna running around with the Zoomies as I am posting this!</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Yes! I just mentioned that to her. Adopting an older cat from a shelter and making its last few years happy. Of course we have to suffer their losses but they’re not supposed to outlive us. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkling_heart.png title=:sparkling_heart: alt=:sparkling_heart: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Even a 5-8 year old cat -</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvLqKakZaedvG60wKxkoKeemnqutdKsoKefX21%2FdYWYbw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
