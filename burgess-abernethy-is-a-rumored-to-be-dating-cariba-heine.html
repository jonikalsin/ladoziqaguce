Her performance as Bridget Sanchez in Blue Water High sparked a lot of discussions. She also nailed the part of Phyllis in The Pacific. Her performance in the television film A Model Daughter: The Killing of Caroline Byrne was also noteworthy.</p><h2>New Girlfriend On The Block?</h2><p>There’s another twist to the plot as well. They don’t seem to be dating since Cariba is dating her boyfriend and partner, Jamie Timony. However, Burgess has also uploaded images of other women on his Instagram account, making it difficult to determine who he sees.
