Waddingham and Sudeikis joined fellow cast members Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Phil Dunster, Toheeb Jimoh, Cristo Fernández and Kola Bokinni for a lively discussion about what to expect next for our favorite footballers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1473825528.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sudeikis spoke about the inception of the Ted Lasso character, which he originally portrayed for a series of NBC Sports promos for England’s Premier League in 2013. The actor created the character and show with Joe Kelly and Hunt, who also stars as Lasso’s right-hand man, Coach Beard, and revealed his now infamous facial hair was inspired by a real-life figure. “The reason I had the mustache was Mike Ditka, the Chicago Bears coach, and in the original commercial I wore little polyester shorts,” he said. “It was all Ditka in this look.” &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1473824421.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In fact, some suggested early on that Lasso be more of a yeller and screamer – not the upbeat optimist he’s become known for. Hunt referred to this version of the character as the “hair dryer treatment.” Elaborated Sudeikis, “When a coach yells so much that your hair blows back, that’s the term.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Instead, “Ted Lasso” became known for his positive outlook, while not shying away from his struggles with panic attacks and mental health issues. But Sudeikis says for the most part, Lasso’s unrelenting optimism has a positive effect on him. “He’s a Weeble Wobble. He’d get knocked over, he’d pop back up and just kind of like, whatever, la-di-da. And it does shape your mindset, and it is pervasive,” said Sudeikis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1473827825.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “‘Ted Lasso’ is, yes, the name of the show and yes, it’s a character, but it’s a vibe. And it’s a vibe that we’re all clicking into. But it wasn’t anything other than a choice, like an old sales technique of answer the phone with a smile. Don’t judge a person. Know that everybody’s life is a comedy, a drama, and a tragedy, and you don’t know which one you’re getting at that moment. And don’t take it personal. There’s all these different stoics and teachers and mystics that have said these things in a much more concise way than I’m saying now, but Ted is the embodiment of that for me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And it’s a vibe that co-star Waddingham thinks was key to the show’s success when it premiered in Aug. 2020. “I think that people – I certainly know I was a little bit tired of the whole endless comedy roasting situation,” she said. “I think it had got a little bit over the top. The fact that you can have something that is heartbreaking and achingly funny and kind, I think it’d become quite unusual. It felt like that needed to be reset.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1473818806.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Waddingham, who plays the owner of AFC Richmond, the team Lasso coaches, also admitted she still doesn’t know much about the sport. “I have to feign that I know anything about football,” she said. “We go to all these amazing matches and I’m just like, ‘People think that I know what’s going on!’ What is Chelsea Football Club? What is that?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Waddingham also spoke about her costar Juno Temple, who plays Rebecca’s best friend Keeley Jones, and how much she appreciates the characters not being pitted against each other. &nbsp;Sudeikis said that in addition to all the show creators having sisters in real-life, he personally witnessed great friendships between women at “Saturday Night Live.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Brendan_Hunt_and_and_Susan_Sarandon_at_the_Variety_and_Apple_TV__Ted_Lasso_Season_3_Screening___Photo_by_Noam_Galai_Getty_Images_.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Women pitted against each other does not compute, you know what I mean?” said Sudeikis. “And it is the good fortune of being an older brother, a brother in general, and having a kitchen filled with my sister’s friends … that overhearing those conversations, all I ever heard was support and love and laughter.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sudeikis referenced the relationship between Meg Ryan and Rosie O’Donnell in “Sleepless in Seattle” and women of “Sex and the City” as being in a similar vein, prompting the question: Is he a big “Sex and the City” fan?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In fact, he is. “I bawled my eyes out!” he said. “When that finaIe [premiered], I lost my mind!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the full conversation above.</p><a class="c-link lrv-u-cursor-pointer lrv-a-font-primary-xs u-color-black lrv-u-text-transform-capitalize lrv-a-icon-after a-icon-long-down-arrow-black a-icon-medium-grey:hover u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-u-display-flex lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-justify-content-center a-content-ignore" href=#>Jump to Comments</a><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva lrv-u-color-black lrv-a-font-secondary-m u-margin-b-150">Sign Up for Variety Newsletters</h2>By providing your information, you agree to our <a href=# rel=nofollow>Terms of Use</a> and our <a href=# rel=nofollow>Privacy Policy</a>.We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. // This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=#>Terms of Service</a> apply.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtqWxzmihmqufo3q0wcOeoKSho2LBprCMpZisq59iwKat0qilZmtdorKvwMClZKGdkaHBqXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
