Given the experience, name, and reputation, Maye Musk’s net worth might see a significant rise this time as well.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_As_A_Dietitian></span>Earnings As A Dietitian<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Amongst the many crowns Maye Musk wears, one is of a dietitian. She earned a master’s degree in dietetics from the University of the Orange Free State in South Africa.</p><p>Likewise, she also earned her second master’s degree in nutritional science from the University of Toronto.

Moreover, she stayed as a chairperson in the Nutrition Entrepreneurs of The American Dietic Association for a year until 2004.</p><p>Posted by <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Maye Musk</a> on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Thursday, 11 February 2021</a></p><p>Before her achievements, she served as the president for Consulting Dietitians of Canada for two years, from 1993 until 1995.</p><p>According to Salary.com, the average salary of a dietitian is $63,850. It falls between $58,117 and $70,160, and the range depends on essential factors like education, experience, certifications, and additional skills.</p><p>Therefore, Maye Musk’s wealth must have doubled, thanks to her entrepreneurship and excellent job skill as a dietitian. Besides wealth, she also earned some awards for her contribution to the nutrition world. Moreover, her career as a model also helped her uplift her prominence as a dietitian.</p><p>As of now, Maye Musk makes her money as an author and speaker.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_As_An_Author></span>Earnings As An Author<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Aforementioned, Maye Musk’s fortune has hiked since she bears the crown of a model, dietician, author, and speaker. After all the experiences and knowledge she accumulated, she decided to share them all via a book.</p><p>Musk’s memoir named A Woman Makes a Plan: Advice for a Lifetime of Adventure, Beauty, and Success, was published late in 2019. Similarly, by 2020, it was made available in six languages in addition to English.</p><p>The book talks about Maye’s career as a model and her entrepreneurial venture. Also, her experience as a kid and learning from her parents to her academic success and also raising three highly triumphant kids is also included in the book.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Moye-Musk-published-her-book-in-2019.jpg><p>Furthermore, Maye Musk’s <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">book sells</a> for $16.01 for hardcover and $11.49 for the Kindle version. Since her book is gaining a good response, her bank accounts must have witnessed a significant rise in money.</p><p>While many are fans of Musk’s book and were inspired by her words but very few felt the book was misleading and did not know its direction. Either way, Maye Musk is also earning good bucks from her books.</p><p>Likewise, Musk’s net worth is also influenced by her career as a spokesperson. She reportedly traveled worldwide, giving talks in several countries’ major cities in the USA, Canada, and South Africa, including Melbourne, Stockholm, Kyiv, and Budapest.</p><p>Hence, Maye Musk’s asset of $20 million makes total sense.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Lavish_Home_in_LA></span>A Lavish Home in LA<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The self-made graceful model and dietitian became a successful person and is still working hard.

About vehicles, she drives, of course, Tesla Model S and tries not to miss SpaceX rocket launches.</p><p>Going through Maye Musk’s Instagram, she uploads pictures of her time in different states. She is in her 70s and looks nowhere near. Maye is as radiant as she can be, aging fine like Cheval Blanc St-Emilion.

Besides, she revealed that the secret of raising billionaires and millionaires was to let them explore themselves.</p><p>Well, Maye Musk’s son, Elon Musk, is the world’s second-richest man with a net worth of $180.6 billion. Similarly, her second child, Kimbal Musk, is worth at least $500 million, and the youngest of all, Tosca Musk, has also built a massive fortune.</p><p>Maye Musk, who re-started her life thrice for her kids, is living lavishly at age 73, actively working and earning cash for herself. Undoubtedly, her primary source of income is modeling, but she also receives side cheques from her books and career as a dietitian. Therefore, we might see a significant rise in her net worth unless she stops working altogether.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
