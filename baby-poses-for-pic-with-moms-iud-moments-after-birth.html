She was already 18 weeks pregnant at the time.</p><p>“My Mirena was nowhere to be found on ultrasound so my OB assumed that it had fallen out, but I wasn’t convinced,” <a href=#>she told Metro,</a> adding that it was later found behind her placenta.</p><p>Since Hellein had been given a May 4 due date — known worldwide as “Star Wars Day” — she believed it was destiny that Dexter was conceived despite her continued use of birth control.</p><p>“Even my OB said The Force is Strong with this one,” <a href=#>she said on Instagram</a>, using the hashtag #littlejedi.</p><p>“This boy was definitely a HUGE surprise. Apparently I’m part of the 1% who end up with a viable mirena pregnancy.”</p><p>The photo of little Dexter holding the IUD has been shared more than 70,000 times on social media since being uploaded last week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j25maWxfl66jxYyppqydo2KzsL6MqaCcZaeewal5zKikrGWZqrFuuc6mnKeso2Kup8DEq2SboaKptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
