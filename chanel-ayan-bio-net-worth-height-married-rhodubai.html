And now, adding one more country to its list, </span><i><span>The Real Housewives of Dubai</span></i><span> is on the horizon with an amazing cast that includes the supermodel Chanel Ayan.</span></p><p><span>So, who is she? This “Chanel Ayan Bio” contains everything you need to know about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Chanel Ayan On RHODubai (Real Housewives Of Dubai)</b></h3><p><i><span>The Real Housewives of Dubai</span></i><span> premiered on June 1, 2022, and like any other franchise, it saw strong 6 independent women, with fascinating lifestyles, all aiming to make it big in the world.</span></p><p><span>Among them, Chanel Ayan is Dubai’s first Black supermodel who was known for her elegance and enviable style. Dubai’s been her home for over 18 years, and she has “watched in awe as the city has been built.”</span></p><p><span>However, not every day is a happy day on RHODubai. Her Bravo description read that Chanel would be confronted by demons from both her past and present until realizes she can only hide behind couture for so long.</span></p><p><span>Joining her for the inaugural season of RHODubai were her co-stars — Nina Ali (a co-founder of a successful cake company), Caroline Brooks (a realtor), Dr. Sara Al Madani (a prolific public speaker), <a href=#>Lesa Milan</a> (a fashion designer), and Caroline Stanbury (a fashion stylist).</span></p><p><span>All excited to appear on the show, Chanel took it to her IG on May 27, 2022, to share a promo clip, captioned, “AYAN BEAUTY Tune on June 1 @bravotv Dress @amatoofficial @furneamato”</span></p><p><span>For those of you who don’t know, RHODubai isn’t Chanel’s first time on TV.

Well, given her over 2 decades of career in the modeling industry, it’s no surprise she was able to rack up a hefty sum.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This incarnation of beauty first started her career after moving to Brazil at 18. However, it was until years later after finally signing a deal with </span><i><span>Elite Model Agency </span></i><span>and settling in the UAE that Chanel found fame and garnered a large following in Africa and the Middle East. She even went on to be the first Black supermodel to grace the cover of a Dubai magazine.</span></p><p><span>Recalling her modeling debut in Dubai, Chanel shared that it took place at a royal Abu Dhabi fashion show.

But her proudest achievement is being the muse for one of the biggest designers in the world, the Amato Couture.</span></p><p><span>However, unlike now, Chanel’s joinery was filled with adversity. As an African woman, she had to fight her way through everything, including event invitations and modeling jobs. But she always respected herself and believed in her own power. Her “unshakeable perseverance, determination, and flat-out refusal to accept anything less than what she deserves” is what got her to this position.</span></p><p><span>In the future, Chanel has thought of some “life-changing” projects.
