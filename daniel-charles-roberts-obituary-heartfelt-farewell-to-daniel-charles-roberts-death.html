Mr. Roberts leaves behind a legacy of service, dedication, and a profound impact on the lives of those who had the privilege of knowing him.&nbsp;Born on August 21, 1955, in Salem, Indiana, Daniel was the son of James Palmer Roberts and Pauline Elizabeth Spurgeon Roberts. His journey through life was marked by resilience, strength, and a commitment to serving his country. Daniel, a field technician for WW Williams, dedicated his professional life to his work, embodying a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility.</p><p>A proud Army veteran, Daniel served his country with honor and distinction during two pivotal periods – the Vietnam War and Desert Storm. His dedication to duty and the sacrifices he made for his fellow countrymen exemplified the true spirit of service. His contributions earned him the respect and gratitude of his community and his nation.&nbsp;A member of the American Legion, Daniel continued his commitment to service even after his military career. The bonds formed within the American Legion showcased his camaraderie with fellow veterans and a shared commitment to supporting one another. Through his involvement, Daniel found a sense of community that mirrored the solidarity he experienced during his time in the Army.</p><p>Daniel’s legacy extends beyond his military and professional achievements to the heart of his family. He is survived by his devoted wife, Mary Jane Fulcher Roberts, whom he married on July 14, 1987. Their enduring partnership was a testament to the love and support that defined their relationship. Together, they navigated life’s challenges, sharing in its joys and sorrows.</p><p>In addition to his wife, Daniel is survived by his daughter, Heather Lyon, residing in Seymour, Indiana, and his son, Paul Roberts, hailing from Russellville, Kentucky. His family was the center of his world, and his role as a father and husband reflected the qualities of love, guidance, and commitment.&nbsp;Daniel’s familial ties extended to his siblings, including his brother, James Larry Roberts (Alice), of Nebo, North Carolina, and his sister, Pat Roberts Hunt, of Salem. These connections formed a support network that added depth to Daniel’s life, creating a tapestry of shared memories and experiences.</p><p>The legacy of Daniel Charles Roberts further flourishes through his seven grandchildren: Jonathan Hartzler (Bethany), Kylie Hartzler (Clayton Zumhingst), Becky Bogard (Nathan), Jordann Lyon, and Remington Lyon. Additionally, he is survived by three great-grandchildren: Adalyn Hartzler, Jaxson Hartzler, and Tristan Ratliff. His impact on the younger generations is evident in the love and admiration they undoubtedly feel for their grandfather.&nbsp;A memorial service to honor and celebrate Daniel’s life will be held on Sunday, January 28, at 3:00 PM at Weathers Funeral Home. Prior to the service, there will be a visitation period with the family starting at 1:00 PM, providing an opportunity for friends and community members to share condolences and reminisce about the life of a remarkable individual.</p><p>In keeping with Daniel’s humble nature and his commitment to making a positive impact on the world, the family requests that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the American Cancer Society in his name. This choice reflects Daniel’s concern for the well-being of others and his desire to contribute to the ongoing fight against cancer, a cause that touches the lives of many.&nbsp;As the community comes together to say goodbye to Mr. Daniel Charles Roberts, they do so with a mix of sadness and gratitude. Sadness for the loss of a cherished member of the community and gratitude for the lasting impact he leaves behind. In honoring his memory, the community can find inspiration in Daniel’s life of service, love, and resilience, carrying forward the values he held dear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMCnoJ6kXZi1or7Lnqpmqp%2BXsrPA0mamm6Gkqq6zxYyhnJqqpJuyrcCMn5irnaeaua1506hknZmenrKtecKhmKuklah6s7vBnqmtq12ZsqLAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
