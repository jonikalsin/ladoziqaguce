He began playing flag football and eventually became a college football starter in his senior year for the juggernaut Alabama Crimson Tides program.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>He wasn’t highly recruited, unlike his peers. Levi&nbsp;was a walk-on who made his own success.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 26-year-old<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>cornerback, however, was overlooked once more in the 2018 draft and signed as an undrafted free agent with the Bills.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi Wallace</a> was&nbsp;even waived and relegated to the practice squad at one point, but it did not dampen his spirits.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>He broke his way into the Bills rotation in his rookie year and received the highest grade among all rookie cornerbacks.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi Wallace</a> eventually formed a formidable duo alongside fellow cornerback Tre’Davious White. He even became the team’s top CB when White dealt with some injury.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>At first glance, it’s easy to count <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi Wallace</a>&nbsp;out since he’s an undersized CB without any special physical traits. He’s not as flashy, nor does he put numbers that pop up in the stat sheet.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi Wallace</a>&nbsp;brings authority, versatility, and skill to that CB position. It didn’t matter whom the Bills drafted or signed in free agency, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi Wallace</a> always found a way to keep his starting spot.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p>In four years in Buffalo, he started 52 games, had six career interceptions, 30 passes defended, two quarterback hits, and 219 total tackles.&nbsp;Bills fans are still grieving his loss and will miss him badly, that’s for sure.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><p class=p1>&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>Are you ready for the next chapter on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi Wallace</a>’s career?
