The league requires clubs wanting to play in the Bundesliga or top-level Division 2 to own at least 50% +1 of the shares. Owning at least 50% +1 of the shares ensures they have majority control so that any potential outside investor knows who runs their club.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Background and Context</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 50+1 rule was born out of the Bundesliga boom in the mid-1990s and aimed to make German football more professional. This forced the breakup of senior football into its own companies, with set provisions that gave AM members majority shareholdings and voting rights in any new entity.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Details & Requirements</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Shareholders are elected to the board. They have supervisory boards rather than 'regular' company boards, as with clubs elsewhere. Chairpersons and directors must also be club members. This prevents any one investor from owning more than a quarter of the side and ensures that control can never be wrested away entirely by the business.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Purpose and Intended Effects</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The prime objective of the 50+1 rule is to secure a continuance of the old fan-club relationship and prevent any disencumbranced external influence by having club members holding ultimate power.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Application in Practice</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A few exceptions have allowed individuals or companies to own a significant majority if they invested considerable amounts in the club for at least twenty years. Still, this rule was only fully put into practice. Some examples are Bayer 04 Leverkusen, VfL Wolfsburg, or the takeover of Software company SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp at TSG1899 Hoffenheim.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Impacts and Effectiveness</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 50+1 rule has also been criticized since, with clubs such as RB Leipzig emerging over the past few years and football governing bodies coming under scrutiny for failing to provide adequate democratic oversight or protection from external investors.</span></p><h2></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 50+1 rule in German football, however unique it may be to the traditional fan-club relationship and constraining of outside influence, the implementation and success are still being debated in legal cases and football practice, and opinions have been divided across professional German football.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miqqJuTmr9wwc2dnKurpJa7pbXNoGStoJVignF5kGaprqSVYravecaeqaaZnmKzsLvTm5ilpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
