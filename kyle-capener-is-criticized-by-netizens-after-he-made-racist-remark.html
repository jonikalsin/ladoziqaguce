Although the tape was part of the live broadcast and did not make the final edit of the day’s program, fans shared it on social media.</p><p>Kyle can be seen in the tape remarking on his fellow competitors’ “different backgrounds” and comparing their alliance to the Cookout, a past all-black alliance on the program. He also told his roommates that sticking together would give them a greater chance of winning, indicating racial differences.&nbsp;People are not just criticizing Capener for his words, but also CBS for not including them in the broadcast. The video triggered a flood of tweets, many of which were critical of the contestant and the show’s producers, and included hashtags like #StopProtectingKyle.</p><h2>What precisely did Kyle Capener say?</h2><p>Capener was discussing survival methods with co-housemates Michael Bruner and Brittany Hoopes when the event occurred. He attempted to persuade Hoopes to spare his in-house colleague Alyssa Snider from the impending eviction. During the discussion, the 29-year-old is heard saying:</p><p>“If you guys can stand up for me, I won’t use the veto, since the Leftovers believe everything is OK, and they don’t think we’re on to anything that they were doing.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kyle-Capener-2.jpg alt="Kyle Capener" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say that the six remaining multicultural contenders could have a greater chance of survival if the public votes for them. Kyle presumed they were working together and likened the group to last season’s all-black Big Brother alliance, Cookout, and said:</p><p>“I mean, it seems quite similar to the Cookout with a really different background, the potential of those six with that history.” They’ve all said why they’re playing this game. More Middle Eastern presence on television, please, Joseph. There has never been a Brazilian candidate or winner, Indy.”</p><p>He went on to add that, in comparison to the varied contenders, he and other white contestants had a lower chance of winning, and he advised his “white” pals to stay together. He stated:</p><p>“Everyone has those powerful ‘whys’ that all coincide.” When I think of our alliance, I think it was amazing because it was born out of need, and our backs were against the wall, and that’s what drew us together.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kyle-Capener-3.jpg alt="Kyle Capener" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The encounter was never shown on air, prompting supporters to accuse CBS of shielding Capener and covering up his racist actions. Viewers also chastised the show’s producers for exposing Taylor Hale, who defended Jasmine because she didn’t want to push out a fellow black woman.</p><h2>“It’s horrible,” said one Twitter user in response to Kyle Capener and CBS.</h2><p>Upset viewers took to social media to express their feelings about the event, accusing Capener of racism and accusing CBS of defending racist conduct.&nbsp;Many even suggested that the show’s producers were portraying Taylor as a “villain” in order to defend Capener and cover up his “racist statements.” They also said that the program did little to help Taylor while she was being bullied aggressively at the start of the season.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Dear casuals, Kyle started a race war of whites vs POC.

One person also criticized CBS for airing Capener’s love life with his racist conduct.&nbsp;Recent occurrences have made Capener a popular target for many viewers, which may cut his time inside the home short.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Kyle Capener</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>reality personality</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiisqSVYrCivMSnnKtlmah6pL7IraCcoaqasW6u2GalnqyZr7Kvv4yana2domK1pnnMmpueZaKWsKq%2F02apnqWRp7hw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
